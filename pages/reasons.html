    <div style="margin:20px;"><br/><h1 style="text-align: center;">Reasons Why Diabetes is Increasing</h1>
    <p>Diabetes is no longer constricted to age. The dreaded condition is now taking alarming proportions in youth.  
There are more than 72 million adults in India with diabetes and worldwide it has afflicted more than 422 million people.
 Basically, Type 1 diabetes which is more common is an autoimmune disease where the immune system goes rogue and destroys the cells producing insulin in the pancreas. 
Hence, a patient requires insulin to survive. Whereas type 2 diabetes is a condition when the body cannot use insulin produced efficiently because of metabolic factors 
resulting in the pancreas to overwork and at some point stop producing insulin completely.</p>

    <h2>Reasons for diabetes in youth</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Unhealthy lifestyle</li>
	    <li>High calorie diet</li>
	    <li>Inactivity</li>
	    <li>Obesity</li>
	    <li>Imbalances in childhood</li>
        </ul>
<h3>Unhealthy lifestyle:</h3>
<img src="./images/food.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>With rapid economic growth the lifestyle of Indians has changed. People today live a more sedentary life than ever before using cars and public transportation instead of walking or riding bicycles and more hours are spent in front of a computer screen and television.</p>

<h3>High calorie diet:</h3>
<img src="./images/calorie.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>Today not only people eat out more often but they prefer Western-style junk food such as burgers and pizza over traditional lentil and vegetable meals.</p>

<h3>Obesity:</h3>
<img src="./images/obesity.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>All these changes have brought in a sharp rise of obesity. We see more obese children and youth today than ever before. This is contrasting as India still has some of the world’s worst levels of malnourishment and children have stunted growth due to a paucity of food.</p>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include:</p>

<h3>Cardiovascular disease</h3>
<p>Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
Nerve damage (neuropathy). Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs.</p>
<h3>Kidney damage (nephropathy)</h3>
<p> The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.</p>
<h3>Eye damage (retinopathy)</h3>
<p> Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.</p>
<h3>Foot damage</h3>
<p> Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation.</p>
<h3>Skin conditions</h3>
<p>Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.</p>
<h3>Hearing impairment</h3>
<p>Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes
Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved.
Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management.</p>

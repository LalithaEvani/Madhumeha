    <h2>Cut sugar and refined carbohydrates from your diet :</h2>
    <p>Eating foods high in refined carbohydrates and sugar increases
    blood sugar and insulin levels, which may lead to diabetes over time. Examples
    of refined carbohydrates include white bread, potatoes and many breakfast
    cereals. Instead, limit sugar and choose complex carbohydrates such as
    vegetables, oatmeal and whole grains.</p>

    <h2>Quit smoking</h2>
    <p>If you are a current tobacco user. Smoking can contribute to insulin
      resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. Quitting has been shown to
      reduce this risk of type 2 diabetes over time.</p>

    <h2>Watch your portions:</h2>
    <p>Avoiding large portion sizes can help reduce insulin and blood
      sugar levels and decrease the risk of diabetes. Eating too much food at one
      time has been shown to cause higher blood sugar and insulin levels in people at
      risk of diabetes.</p>

    <h2>Aim for 30 :</h2>
    <p>Try to be intentionally active by taking a walk, dancing,
      lifting weights or swimming for 30 minutes, five days per week. If you get no
      or very little physical activity—and you sit during most of your day—then you
      lead a sedentary lifestyle, and it's time to get moving.</p>

    <h2>Drink water :</h2>
    <p>Drinking water instead of other beverages may help control blood
      sugar and insulin levels, thereby reducing the risk of diabetes. Sticking with
      water most of the time helps you avoid beverages that are high in sugar,
      preservatives and other unneeded ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Eat fiber :</h2>
    <p>Getting plenty of fiber is beneficial for gut health and weight
      management. Consuming a good fiber source at each meal can help prevent spikes
      in blood sugar and insulin levels, which may help reduce your risk of
      developing diabetes</p>

    <h2>Choose Carbs Carefully :</h2>
    <p>Diabetes doesn't mean
      you have to cut carbs completely. Choose carbohydrates that break down in the
      body slowly, providing steady energy. Reach for whole grains, beans, nuts, and
      fresh vegetables and fruits. Yes, you can eat fruit even though it's sweet.
      It's about eating the right amounts of carbohydrates at each meal. A registered
      dietitian can help you learn how much is right for you.</p>

    <h2>Get Enough Sleep :</h2>
    <p>Getting too much or too little sleep can
      increase your appetite and cravings for high-carb foods. That can lead to
      weight gain, increasing your risk for complications such as heart disease. So
      shoot for seven or eight hours of sleep a night. If you have sleep apnea,
      treating it can improve your sleep and lower your blood sugar levels.</p>

    <h2>Monitor your Blood sugar Daily :</h2>
    <p>You know you're&nbsp;<i>supposed</i>&nbsp;to check it.
      And actually checking your blood glucose levels can help you avoid diabetes
      complications, like nerve pain, or keep them from getting worse. Checking it
      can also help you see how foods and activities affect you, and if your
      treatment plan is working. Your doctor can help you set a target glucose level
      range. The closer you get to your target, the better you'll feel.</p>

      <h2>Manage Stress :</h2>
     <p>When you have diabetes, stress can cause your blood
      glucose levels to rise. Get rid of whatever physical or mental stresses you
      can. Learn coping techniques to deal with others. Relaxation techniques such as
      breathing exercises, yoga, and meditation may be especially effective if you
      have type 2 diabetes.</p>

    <h2>Optimse the vitamin D levels :</h2>
    <p>Consuming a good fiber source at each meal can help prevent
      spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, which may help reduce your risk of
      developing diabetes. Solar energy is a great source of vitamin D. Exposing oneself at dusk and dawn can help a great deal.</p>

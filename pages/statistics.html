            <p><b>From the above table we can conclude that:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>8% are known diabetes and 3.8% are newly diagnosed diabetes</li>
                <li>Among 8% known diabetes males are considerably higher than females in known diabetes.</li>
                <li>Whereas females are a little higher for newly diagnosed diabetes than males.</li>
            </ul>

            <br /><br />
            <p><b>From the above table we can conclude that:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diabetes is more prevalent in age groups of 70-79</li>
                <li>This is followed by 60-69 age group</li>
                <li>Among the more prevalent group of 70-79 proportion of men is greater than women</li>

            <img src="./images/treatment.png" />
            <br /><br />
            <p><b>From above we can conclude that </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the diabetic people rely on tablets. From this we can say that most diabetic people are of type-2</li>
                <li>There are 5.9% people diagnosed with diabetes and not undergoing any treatment. This is a case to be considered. They are to be provided with awareness regarding the importance of treatment for diabetes</li>
                <li>We can also see about 2.9% only following proper diet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Retina Examination</h3>
            <br />
            <p>It is known that diabetes can cause damage to retina. So proper checkup and diagnosis is essential. </p>
            <br />
            <img src="./images/retina-exam.png" />

            <p><b>From the pie chart above we can conclude that </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Majority of diabetic people have not undergone any examination of retina.</li>
                <li>We can conclude that a lot of people are not considering the side effects of diabetes seriously</li>
                <li> So it is crucial to bring awareness regarding the importance of regular checkup of retina, kidney,etc.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Impact on organs</h3>
            <br />
            <p>In the below diagram we can notice the percentage of people with diabetes who had the below effects on their kidneys</p>
            <img src="./images/impact-organs.jpg" />
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>About 69 percent suffer from Neuropathy</li>
                <li>Retinopathy and Nephropathy also can be seen in significant percentage</li>
                <li>Hence, its important that we not only take care of ourselves at the time of diabetes but also be careful regarding its effects.</li>
                <li>We have to keep an eye on all the systems in our body that get effected by diabetes as shown below and can follow natural remedies to make them stay healthy</li>
                <li>Those who do not suffer from diabetes have to understand the side effects of diabetes and should know the reasons that lead to diabetes and must try to avoid them.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>In the right side of the image we can see the statistics of medication. It could be oral anti-diabetic drugs(OAD), insulin, both.This data is based on the <b>Sanofi's Landmarc study</b></p>
            <p>From the above pie chart we can conclude that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are a high proportion of patients who rely on only OAD</li>
            </ul>

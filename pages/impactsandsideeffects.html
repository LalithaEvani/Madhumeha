    <p>Diabetes is a condition in which there is too much glucose (a type of sugar) in the blood. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the body's organs. 
Possible long-term effects include damage to large (macrovascular) and small (microvascular) blood vessels, 
which can lead to heart attack, stroke, and problems with the kidneys, eyes, gums, feet and nerves.
 effects of diabetes by keeping blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels within recommended range. 
Also, being a healthy weight, eating healthily,
 reducing alcohol intake, and not smoking will help reduce your risk.</p>

<h3>Eyes and diabetes</h3>

<p>retinopathy – retinopathy is when blood vessels in the retina become damaged which eventually affects your vision.
 Retinopathy has various stages. In its early stages, there are usually no symptoms, so having a full diabetes eye check is essential to detect it early. 
Regular eye checks help detect any changes and allow for early treatment where needed to prevent further damage</p>

<h3>Kidneys and diabetes</h3>
<img src="./images/kidney.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>People with diabetes are at risk of kidney disease (nephropathy) due to changes in the small blood vessels of the kidneys. Kidney disease is painless and does not cause symptoms until it is advanced.
Screening is very important. Kidney damage can be diagnosed early by checking for microalbumin (very small amounts of protein) in the urine at least once a year. Your doctor will also check your kidney function, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR), with a blood test.</p>

<h3>Nerves and diabetes</h3>
<img src="./images/nerve.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>Nerve damage (neuropathy) is usually caused by high blood glucose levels, although similar nerve damage can also result from:
->drinking large amounts of alcohol
->vitamin B12 deficiency – long-term use of the diabetes medication Metformin (over three to five years) can increase the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. Your doctor may test for this.
Damage can occur to the sensory (feeling) and motor (movement) nerves of the legs and feet, arms, hands, chest and stomach, and to the nerves that control the actions of body organs. </p>
<h3>Feet and diabetes</h3>
<img src="./images/feet.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>The feet of someone with diabetes are at risk of damage when the blood supply in both large and small blood vessels is reduced. Nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy) often results and problems to the structure of the foot can also occur – for example, clawed toes.
Reduced blood supply and nerve function can delay healing, increase the risk of infection, reduce feeling in the feet, and lead to ulcers and structural foot problems.</p>
<h3>Oral health and diabetes</h3>
<img src="./images/oral.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>People with poorly managed diabetes are at increased risk of tooth decay and gum infections. This is because the small blood vessels that help nourish your teeth and gums can become damaged. (Dental and gum infections can also lead to high blood glucose levels.) 

Poor oral care can cause the gums to become inflamed and loosen around your teeth. It's also strongly linked with an increased risk of heart disease.</p>
<h3>Mental health and diabetes</h3>
<img src="./images/mental1.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>Living with and managing either type 1 or type 2 diabetes can lead to stress, anxiety and depression. This can affect your blood glucose levels and how you manage your diabetes in general. Over time, this can affect your health.

It is important to talk to your doctor if you are going through times of stress, depression or anxiety. Your doctor can refer you to a counsellor or psychologist by providing a diabetes mental health plan. This is Medicare rebated.</p>
<h3>Thyroid and diabetes</h3>
<img src="./images/thyroid.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<p>People with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of thyroid disease. This includes both overactive and underactive thyroid. Thyroid disorders can affect general health and may affect blood glucose levels.
Thyroid function is assessed by a blood test. Talk to your doctor to see if you have had your thyroid function checked.</p>

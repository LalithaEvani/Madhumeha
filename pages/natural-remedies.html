    <h2>Apple Cider Vinegar</h2>
    
    <p>
    The primary compound in ACV
    is acetic acid and is believed to be responsible for many of its health
    benefits. There are many evidence-based approaches to using
    ACV. Taking 2 tablespoons before bedtime can reduce your morning fasting
    sugar levels. Even better, 1-2 tablespoons of ACV taken with meals
    can decrease the glycemic load of a carbohydrate rich meal. I
    generally tell patients to either consume ACV alone, prior to a meal or mix it
    into salad dressings or teas.</p>

    <h2>Fiber and Barley</h2>
    
    <p >Eating
    fiber decreases blood sugar and insulin concentrations. The
    recommended amount of fiber is around 30 grams per day. Most Americans
    get around 6-8 grams, which is not nearly enough. While you can
    take fiber supplements like Metamucil (psylium husk), the best way to reach
    your goal is to eat your veggies! Barley is a high-fiber, high-protein
    grain which has lots of data to support its role in helping improve blood
    sugar, insulin, cholesterol and general inflammation. Barley does not requiring
    soaking and usually can cook in less than 15 minutes on the stove top with just
    some water and salt.</p>

    <h2>Zinc</h2>
    
    <p >Those with diabetes are
    commonly found to be zinc deficient. Studies have shown zinc
    supplementation can reduce blood sugar and A1C, have an antioxidant effect,
    lower blood sugar and even help treat some of the complications related to
    diabetes. Large doses of zinc can inhibit the absorption of other
    minerals like copper, so be sure to ask for guidance of the appropriate dosing.</p>

    <h2>Aloe Vera</h2>
    
    <p>The
    sap of aloe vera is known for its laxative effect. Therefore, make sure
    to get the juice of the gel! There is increasing evidence for use of the gel,
    which is the mucilaginous material inside the leaves.</p>
    <img src="./images/aloevera.jfif">
    
    <h2>Berberine</h2><br>This
    is one of my all-time favorite botanicals found in plants such as goldenseal,
    barberry, Oregon grape root and Coptis. Current evidence supports its use
    for decreasing blood sugar and hba1c. Be aware that this herb can interfere
    with metabolism of traditional pharmaceuticals and should never be taken while
    pregnant</p>

    <h2>Cinnamon</h2>
    <p>Cinnamon
     is a fragrant spice that comes from the bark of a tree. It is a popular
    ingredient in sweets and baked goods, as well as some savory dishes. This spice
    may add sweetness to a dish, limiting the need for sugar. It is popular among
    people with type 2 diabetes for this reason alone, but it may also have other
    benefits. Cinnamon may improve levels of :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>glucose</li>
        <li>insulin and insulin sensitivity</li>
        <li>lipids,or fats, in the blood</li>
        <li>antioxidants</li>
        <li>blood pressure</li>
        <li>digestion</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./images/cinnamon.jpg">
    <h2>Ginger</h2>
    
    <p >Gingeris another herb that people have used for thousands
    of years in traditional medicines. People often use ginger to help treat
    digestive and inflammatory issues..</p>
    
    <p >People can take ginger:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>by adding it powdered or fresh and thinly sliced to raw or cooked
            dishes</li>
        <li>brewed into tea</li>
        <li>as a supplement in capsule form</li>
        <li>by drinking it in ginger ale</li>
    </ul>

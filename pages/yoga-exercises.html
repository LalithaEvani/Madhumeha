            <p>An increasing number of people with diabetes mellitus are turning to yoga in an effort to
            keep their condition under control and improve overall quality of life. It is
            well known that regular practice of yoga can help reduce levels of stress,
            enhance mobility, lower blood pressureand improve overall wellbeing.It
    involves various body postures and movements (known as asanas), breathing
    techniques and meditation, which are all designed to promote physical
    comfort and mental composure.</p>
    
    <h2>Benefits of Yoga for people with Diabetes</h2>
    
    <p >Yoga is
    considered to be a promising, cost-effective option in the treatment and
    prevention of diabetes, with data from several studies suggesting that yoga and
    other mind-body therapies can reduce stress-related hyperglycemia and have a
    positive effect on blood glucose control. Controlling
    mental stress (stress management) is one of the keys of diabetes treatment When
    we’re stressed, our blood sugar levels increase and elevated blood sugar levels
    increase the chances of serious complications such as heart disease.</p>
    
    <h2>Other main benefits:</h2>
    <p>Yoga can also treat diabetes or  prevent the disease from
    developing by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rejuvenating pancreatic cells-</b>Yoga postures that aid relaxation (asanas) stretch the pancreas, which can
            stimulate the production of insulin-producing beta cells.</li>
        <li><b>Exercising the muscles-</b>Like other forms of exercise, yoga increases glucose uptake by muscular cells,
            which in turn, helps to lower blood sugar levels, improve circulation and
            reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>
        <li><b>Promoting weight loss-</b>Exercising through yoga can reduce weight and improve weight control, both of
            which are essential for protecting against conditions such as type 2 diabetes,
            cancer and heart disease, as well as diabetes management.</li>
        <li><b>Improving your mental attitude-</b>Regular yoga practice can help to focus the mind and create the right mental
            approach to dealing with diabetes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Dietary management of diabetes with Yoga</h2>
    <p>Yoga is
        also known to regulate eating patterns, and its potential utility in the
        management of eating disorders has been advocated. It is believed that the
        mind-body connection that stems from yoga practice provides opportunities for
        self-awareness, reflection, and change.Yoga, pranayama, and sudarshan kriya were found to
    be beneficial in improving dietary practices and medication adherence.</p>
    
    <h2>Yoga
        practise and mindful Eating</h2>
    
    <p>Yoga
    participation has been correlated with both fruit and vegetable intake, as well
    as improved eating habits and mindful eating practices [Meditation and ability
    to heighten mindfulness may be beneficial in controlling binge-eating patterns.
    Mindful eating in diabetes has shown to facilitate improvements in dietary
    intake, modest weight loss, and glycaemic control</p>

	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Exercises and  Diabetes</h1>
	 <h3>Walking</h3>
    
    <p >You don’t need a gym membership or expensive exercise equipment to get moving.
	If you have a supportive pair of shoes and a safe place to walk, you can start today. In fact, you can meet your recommended minimum target for aerobic fitness by going for a brisk 30-minute walk five days a week.
According to a 2014 review, walking can help people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood sugar levels and lose weight.
</p>
<img src="./images/e1.jpg">
 <h3>Cycling</h3>
    
<p >Roughly half of people with type 2 diabetes have arthritis. The two conditions have several risk factors in common, including obesity.

Diabetic neuropathy, a condition that occurs when the nerves become damaged, can also cause joint pain in people with type 2 diabetes.

If you have lower joint pain, consider choosing low-impact exercise. Cycling, for example, can help you meet your fitness goals while minimizing strain on your joints.


</p>
<img src="./images/e2.jpg">
 <h3>Swimming</h3>
    
    <p >Aquatic activities provide another joint-friendly exercise option. For example, swimming, water aerobics, aqua jogging, and other aquatic activities can give your heart, lungs, and muscles a workout, while putting little stress on your joints.
</p>
<img src="./images/e3.jfif">
 <h3>Sports</h3>
    
    <p > If you find it hard to motivate yourself to exercise, 
	it might help to join a recreational sports team. The opportunity to socialize with teammates and the commitment you make to them might help you find the motivation you need to show up each week.
</p>
<img src="./images/e4.jfif">

 <h3>Aerobic dance</h3>
    
    <p >Signing up for an aerobic dance or other fitness class might also help you meet your exercise goals. For instance, Zumba is a fitness program that combines dance and aerobic movements for a fast-paced workout.</p>
<img src="./images/e5.jfif">
 <h3>Weight lifting</h3>
    
    <p >Weightlifting and other strengthening activities help build your muscle mass, which can increase the number of calories you burn each day. Strength training may also help improve your blood sugar control, reports the ADA.

If you want to incorporate weightlifting into your weekly exercise routine, you can use weight machines, free weights,
 or even heavy household objects, such as canned goods or water bottles.
</p>
<img src="./images/e6.jfif">
 <h3>Resistance band exercises</h3>
    
    <p >Weights aren’t the only tool that you can use to strengthen your muscles. You can also perform a wide variety of strengthening activities with resistance bands.

To learn how to incorporate them into your workouts, speak with a professional trainer, take a resistance band class, or watch a resistance band workout video.

In addition to increasing your strength, exercising with resistance bands may provide modest benefits to your blood sugar control, according to a recent study published 
in the Canadian Journal of Diabetes.</p>
<img src="./images/e7.jfif">
 <h3>Calisthenics</h3>
    
    <p >In calisthenics, you use your own body weight to strengthen your muscles. Common calisthenic exercises include pushups, pullups, squats, lunges, and abdominal crunches.

Whether you choose to strengthen your muscles with weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight, try to work out every major muscle group in your body.

To give your body time to recover, take a day off from muscle-strengthening activities between each session of strength training, 
suggests the ADA.</p>
<img src="./images/e8.jfif">
 <h3>Pilates</h3>
    
    <p >Pilates is a popular fitness program that’s designed to improve core strength, coordination, and balance. According to a recent study of older women with type 2 diabetes, it may also help improve blood sugar control.

Consider signing up for a Pilates class at your local gym or Pilates studio. Many instructional videos and books are also available.

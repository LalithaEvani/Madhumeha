Diabetic web application 

Developing countries such as India face a huge burden of diabetes and its complications.

India is home to 77 million diabetic patients; it is the second highest in the world.

Even children at the age of five are suffering from this disorder. 

It is high time that people understand the gravity of the situation and make themselves fit to fight the disorder than to suffer with it.

There is a need to bring awareness among people so that they can avoid situations that lead to diabetes, understand and identify the symptoms of diabetes at an early stage, consult the best doctors and get medications at affordable rates.Â 

The website helps people in understanding everything about diabetes and helps them in taking care of themselves and guiding them to prevent or fight against this chronic disorder. 

I basically covers doctor list pertaining to Tirupati only and can be extended if included as a real time application

The application is built using HTML and CSS. It is a responsive layout.
